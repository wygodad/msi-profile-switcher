# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here.
Format loosely based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/).

## [1.8.2] - 2026-06-29
### Changed
- Fan curve enable is now a **toggle switch** (consistent with the rest of the app), with a separate label.
### Fixed
- Fan duty readings are clamped to 100% (the raw PWM byte could read slightly above 100, e.g. "103%").

## [1.8.1] - 2026-06-29
### Fixed
- **Profile detection** now relies solely on the fan byte `0xD4` (`1D` = Silent). Diffing full EC dumps of all four MSI Center 2.0.48 scenarios proved `0x34` is the **Extreme power-unlock** flag (`00` only in Extreme), not a Silent/Balanced marker — so it no longer affects detection.
- **`0x34` in the profile recipes** corrected to match MSI exactly (`00` in Extreme, `01` elsewhere; previously reversed), so Extreme actually unlocks full power.
### Changed
- **Fan curve** is repositioned as manual fan control. On Balanced / Extreme / Super Battery it only changes the fans (lossless). On Silent it must leave Silent — because Silent's power cap lives in the *same byte* (`0xD4`) as the curve — so the app warns and switches to Balanced.
- Status tab and TECHNICAL docs (PL/EN) updated to describe `0x34` correctly and the `0xD4` Silent-cap/curve overlap.

## [1.8.0] - 2026-06-29
### Added
- **Bulk model import** (~126 new MSI laptops, all **Experimental** / opt-in) generated from the
  [msi-ec](https://github.com/BeardOverflow/msi-ec) register maps and cross-checked against
  [MControlCenter](https://github.com/dmitry-s93/MControlCenter): the full **G2 family** (Raider /
  Vector / Titan / Stealth 16-18 / Sword / Pulse / Crosshair / Katana / Cyborg / Bravo / Modern /
  Prestige / Summit) on shift `0xD2` / fan `0xD4` / super-batt `0xEB`, and the **G1 family** (older
  GS / GF / GE / GP, Modern, Alpha, Bravo, Delta, Creator) on shift `0xF2` / fan `0xF4` / charge `0xEF`.
- **Read-only fan-curve preview on the whole G2 family**: the curve tables use the fixed modern layout
  (CPU `0x6A`/`0x72`, GPU `0x82`/`0x8A`) that MControlCenter reads/writes across this family, so the
  addresses are practice-confirmed rather than guessed. The preview stays unverified
  (`FanCurveSpec.Verified=false`) until the user compares it with MSI Center on their own model; G1
  models get profiles only (their EC layout differs and the curve addresses are not confirmed).
- Models whose msi-ec config documents **no Silent fan value** (some GF75 Thin, GP65/GL65 & GP75/GL75
  Leopard, GS75 Stealth, GE63, GT72) were intentionally left out — Silent is this app's core function
  and writing an unconfirmed value would be a guess.
### Fixed
- **GS66 Stealth (`16V1EMS1`)** was using G2 EC registers (`0xD2`/`0xD4`) on what is actually a G1
  board; corrected to `0xF2`/`0xF4` per the msi-ec `CONF_G1_3` map.

## [1.7.0] - 2026-06-29
### Added
- **Fan curve editor** (new tab + tray entry): drag CPU (Fan 1) and GPU (Fan 2) speed points; a single **Custom fan curve** checkbox writes the curve as an Advanced fan overlay on the *current* power mode (e.g. a custom curve in Silent, which MSI Center does not allow), with an **MSI default** preset and a live **fan-mode** indicator. Unchecking hands the fans back to the active profile.
- **Read-only fan-curve preview** for the modern experimental models (GE68HX 13V, GS66 Stealth, Katana GF66/GF76, GE66 Raider / GP66 Leopard, Crosshair A16 HX) — confirmed against community EC dumps; editing is gated by the Experimental opt-in.
- **Status** tab expanded: a live **profile-byte matrix** (`0xD2`/`0x34`/`0xEB`/`0xD4`) with the active profile highlighted in its colour and a **Now (live)** row, a **byte legend** with value descriptions, and **live fan-curve tables**. Fan counters now labelled **CPU:** / **GPU:** RPM.
### Fixed
- **Profile no longer flips to Balanced** when a custom fan curve is active: profile detection is decoupled from the fan byte (the poll keeps the chosen profile while the fan runs in Advanced mode). See `docs/TECHNICAL.md` §17.
- **Smooth scrolling** on the Status page — the content is now painted on an inner canvas that WinForms scrolls natively, removing the ghosting/smearing during scroll and resize.

## [1.5.1] - 2026-06-29
### Added
- **Fan RPM** in Status: real CPU/GPU fan speed shown as framed counters under the fan rings (verified on the Raider GE78HX 13V — `0xC9`/`0xCB`, `RPM = 478000 / raw`), alongside **CPU usage** (distinct colour) and a **RAM** usage bar with values.
- Hidden EC test / discovery tools (**Ctrl+Shift+T**) for bringing up new models: RPM finder, live RPM, read-only EC dump, and an Advanced-fan experiment. Documented in `docs/TECHNICAL.md` §16.

## [1.5.0] - 2026-06-28
### Added
- **New tabbed main window** styled after MSI Center: top tabs for **Scenarios**, **Status**, **Settings**, **Report model**, and **Updates** — opening Status or Report from the tray now shows that content inside the same window.
- **Scenarios** tab with large clickable profile tiles (icon + name + hint), plus inline **charge limit** and **AC/battery auto-switch** controls.
- **Status** tab with CPU/GPU temperature and CPU/GPU fan ring gauges plus a details table.
- **Settings** tab fully inline and grouped into cards (appearance, power, startup, updates, hotkeys) with a **restore default hotkeys** button — no more separate dialog.
- **Updates** tab: installed version, "check now" with last-checked time, and the last 5 releases with changelog highlights.
- **Light / dark theme** toggle (persisted), and the main window remembers its size and position.

## [1.4.1] - 2026-06-28
### Added
- Experimental support for **MSI Crosshair A16 HX (D7W/D8W)** (firmware `15PLIMS1`), added from a community EC snapshot ([#2](https://github.com/wygodad/msi-profile-switcher/issues/2)). Shift/fan registers match the G2 recipe exactly; uses no super-battery register and leaves a secondary fan bit untouched pending hardware verification.

## [1.4.0] - 2026-06-27
### Added
- **Automatic update check**: once a day the app asks GitHub for the latest release and, if a newer version exists, shows a tray notification and a green **"⬇ Download new version"** menu item — one click opens the Releases page. Read-only, failures are silent, and it can be turned off in **Settings → Power → "Check for updates"** (on by default).

## [1.3.1] - 2026-06-27
### Fixed
- "Report my model" wizard: taller default window so the left column's **Firmware EC** row is fully visible (notably in the Polish UI, where the longer text pushed it off-screen). The window height also stays user-resizable.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-06-27
### Added
- **"Report my model…" wizard** (tray menu + button in the Status window): a modern, animated dialog that guides a read-only EC capture in each MSI Center scenario (live per-byte progress bar), builds the full report, copies it to the clipboard, saves it to a file, and opens a pre-filled GitHub "Model support request" — no PowerShell, no manual copy-paste. Includes guidance to use MSI Center 2.0.48 (last version with a working SILENT scenario), direct download links (Uptodown, with the version list as a fallback), and a link to MSI's official uninstaller. The `scripts/diagnostics/` flow remains as a fallback and for post-BIOS re-derivation.

## [1.2.3] - 2026-06-27
### Added
- Tray menu profile entries now show a coloured swatch matching each profile's colour (custom colours included); the active profile's swatch is highlighted.

## [1.2.2] - 2026-06-27
### Added
- Coloured tier badge in the Status window: green **TESTED**, amber **EXPERIMENTAL**, red **UNSUPPORTED**.
- `MSIPS_FORCE_FIRMWARE` developer switch to preview the experimental / unsupported UI — it simulates a firmware and performs **no EC writes**.
### Fixed
- Status "Model" row no longer overflows; the full model name is shown and the tier moved into the badge.

## [1.2.1] - 2026-06-26
### Added
- Tested / Experimental indicator in the Status window and tray menu.
### Changed
- Diagnostic scripts (`scripts/diagnostics/`) translated to English; clearer step-by-step model-support issue template.
### Fixed
- Status "Model" row overflow that overlapped the CPU temperature line (ellipsis + tooltip + wider window).

## [1.2.0] - 2026-06-26
### Added
- Experimental support for 7 MSI "Gaming Intel" models — GE68HX 13V, GS66 / GS65 Stealth, Katana GF66 / GF76, GE66 Raider / GP66 Leopard, GF65 Thin — built from the [msi-ec](https://github.com/BeardOverflow/msi-ec) register maps.
- Device **tier** system (Tested vs Experimental) and an **opt-in** toggle for experimental models (Settings → Power).

## [1.1.0] - 2026-06-26
### Added
- Multi-model device layer and a **firmware safety gate**: on an unrecognized EC firmware the app stays read-only (no writes).
- "Model support request" issue template for community contributions.

## [1.0.1] - 2026-06-26
### Added
- "Always on top" toggle for the Status window (persisted).
### Fixed
- Status window widened and header auto-sized so profile names are no longer cut off.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-06-26
### Added
- Initial release. Tray app to switch MSI power profiles (Silent / Balanced / Extreme / Super Battery) via the tray menu or global hotkeys, with an on-screen overlay.
- 8 UI languages, per-profile colours, Status / Diagnostics window (live CPU/GPU temperatures & fans via EC), autostart, AC/battery auto-switch, battery charge limit.
- EC control through MSI's official WMI interface (`root\wmi` → `MSI_ACPI`) — no kernel driver, no security changes.
